# Weighted Strings

Time Complexity: O(n + q) where n is the length of the input string and q is the number of queries. (still O(n) since q is a constant)

# Balanced Bracket

The isBalanced has a loop iterates through each character of the input string once.
Thus, the entire loop contributes ( O(n) ) to the time complexity, where ( n ) is the length of the input string.

# Highest Palindrome

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input number. though the recursion depth is at most (n/2) which is O(n) as well.
